  <h1>Reel Talk: Race On Campus is a project 

that archives the narratives of MassArt 

community members on film. This 

multi-generational series of interviews 

will document the undisclosed racial 

encounters that impact oneâ€™s overall 

experience on campus. In addition to 

generating a forum for discussion through 

video installation and exhibition, the goal 

is for real talk to catalyze change within 

our institution.</h1>
