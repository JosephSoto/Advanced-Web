<p><em>Project one</em>
	<em>Description</em> In Typography III, we're playing both the designer's and editor's role in a printed magazine. We were required to source all of our content from existing magazines, publications, and online resources (or create our own). I've received permission from Lynn Faitelson to use that content in this project, using this assignment as the digital version of the magazine. This scrolling site will feature a single article that is featured in the printed version as a three spread interview. The subject of my magazine is "Exploration" of the LGBT community through the lense of nightlife personalities.  </p>
	<br>
	<p><em>Overview</em>
As the user scrolls through the site, the featured article of this issue will be presented in fragments. There will be call-outs, large images, and bold typography. The main artcle features a lot of copy, which is why I intend on breaking it up through styles and animations.
	</p><br>
	
		<p><em>Animations</em><br>
-Full screen image in the header, (100% width) zooms in slowly, then stops.<br> 
-Article title slides in from the right. Sits onto of image.<br>

-Quote from interviewee fades in, its scale pulses, color changes. An introduction to copy.<br>

-Interview begins. Parallax scroll between images, videos and copy. <br>
-Background color changes occasionaly.
